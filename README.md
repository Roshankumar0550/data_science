The main objective of this project is to build a model that predicts customers that would subscribe
to a bank term deposit, and it was achieved by considering 2 different models and using the best one
for the prediction. Preliminary Data Analysis is performed to clean the data set. Bi-variate analysis
and multivariate analysis is used to gather insights from the data set with help of various graphs and
plots.Logistic Regression model is used to predict the test data set. But as the data may have nonlinearity.
Decision tree classifier model is used on the data set.I went through rigorous steps of
preparing the data for the model and choosing various evaluation metrics to measure the
performance of the models.The resultant accuracy of the predictive model was more than 90
percent.
